# Titanic Survival Prediction
## Overview
This project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using logistic regression and decision tree models. The dataset includes passenger details like age, gender, class, and embarkation point. The study covers data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation metrics to determine the most effective survival prediction method.

## Objectives
- Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode variables.
- Model Training: Implement logistic regression and decision tree models.
- Model Evaluation: Assess accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
  
## Methodology
- Data Processing: Address missing values, encode variables.
- Model Creation: Develop logistic regression and decision tree models.
- Training and Evaluation: Assess performance, compare results.
  
## Results
The project evaluates logistic regression and decision tree models for predicting Titanic survival, providing insights into model effectiveness.

## Conclusion
This study contributes valuable insights into predicting passenger survival on the Titanic, aiding future analyses and decision-making.
